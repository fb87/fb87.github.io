Code red!&quot; Stiggs was on the phone immediately, ordering more rose blossoms, because, according to him, the ones floating in the tub had suddenly lost their smell. &quot;I demand smell,&quot; he shrilled. &quot;I expecting total uninterrupted smell from these f*cking roses.&quot;</p><p>Unfortunately, the service captain didn't realize that the Stiggs situation involved fifty roses. &quot;What am I going to do with this?&quot; Stiggs sneered at the weaseling hotel goon when he appeared at our door holding a single flower floating in a brandy glass. Stiggs's tirade was great. &quot;Do you see this bathtub? Do you notice any difference between the size of the tub and the size of that spindly wad of petals in your hand? I need total bath coverage. I need a completely solid layer of roses all around me like puffing factories of smell, attacking me with their smell and power-ramming big stinking concentrations of rose odor up my nostrils until I'm wasted with pleasure.&quot; It wasn't long before we got so dissatisfied with this incompetence that we bolted. -- The Utterly Monstrous, Mind-Roasting Summer of O.C. and Stiggs, National Lampoon, October 1982</p></main><hr><div width="100%" style="text-align: right;"><small style="color: grey;">Copyright Â©2021 SI DAO</small></div><script language="Javascript">var app = angular.module("finder", []);
