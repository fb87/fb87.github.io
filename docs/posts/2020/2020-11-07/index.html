We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles, and all manner of sundry items for which His Majesty's Government holds me accountable. I have dispatched reports on the character, wit, and spleen of every officer. Each item and every farthing has been accounted for, with two regrettable exceptions for which I beg your indulgence. Unfortunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains unaccounted for in one infantry battalion's petty cash and there has been a hideous confusion as the number of jars of raspberry jam issued to one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm in western Spain. This reprehensible carelessness may be related to the pressure of circumstance, since we are war with France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise to you gentlemen in Whitehall. This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty's Government so that I may better understand why I am dragging an army over these barren plains. I construe that perforce it must be one of two alternative duties, as given below. I shall pursue either one with the best of my ability, but I cannot do both: 1. To train an army of uniformed British clerks in Spain for the benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London or perchance: 2. To see to it that the forces of Napoleon are driven out of Spain. -- Duke of Wellington, to the British Foreign Office, London, 1812</p></main><hr><div ng-controller="Discussion"><a href="#" ng-click="find_comment(1)">[ Show ]</a> comments<ul><li ng-repeat="comment in comments">[<a href="{{ comment.user.html_url }}">{{ comment.user.login }}</a> - {{ comment.updated_at }}] <a href="{{ comment.html_url }}">{{ comment.body }}</a></li></ul><p ng-bind="warn_message"></p><span ng-if="!no_discussion"><a href="{{ discussion }}')">[ Join ]</a> discussion</span></div><hr><div width="100%" style="text-align: right;"><small style="color: grey;">Copyright Â©2021 SI DAO</small></div><script language="Javascript" src="/style/js/prism.min.js"></script><script language="Javascript" src="/style/js/index.min.js"></script></body></html>
