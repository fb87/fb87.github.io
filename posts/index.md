## [A Markdown Viewer](albert-einstein/markdown-viewer.md)

[Sun Oct 20 12:57:18 AM +07 2024]

I have bunch of markdown documents, I just wanna public it over e.g github page, possible?

> Sure! use such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - static website generator to translate all markdown files to a website and then commit to github page repository, done.

Means, I have to run **hugo** all the time whenever there is something updated?
